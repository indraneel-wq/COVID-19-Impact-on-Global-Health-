# COVID-19-Impact-on-Global-Health
In this project, I have not only performed Data Analysis but also Machine Learning model for the future prediction purpose(uisng Time Series Forecasting).
Data cleaning, Data preprocessing, Data transformation, Model building (if needed for prediction ), Visual Analysis for meaningful insights.
In this project, I have done the data analysis of the report of COVID cases.
Inorder to do that I have first upload .csv dataset of the covid-19 using pandas library.
After that I have checked weather the cloumns are correct having their datatypes and if not I have transformed the datatypes of that particular columns.
I have checked for null values and duplicated values in the columns and depending upon their count, I have decided weather we have to drop that values or replace it depending upon their datatypes.
Then I have grouped important columns together and I started performing operations on then.
Then I have plotted some of the graphs to get insights from it.
Additionally I have build the model for future prediction of the cases for 7 days using  Facebook's Prophet(which is developed to use on the Time Series data Forecasting) for different columns.
After that I have used plotly express for 3-D visualise the data to find the Active, Recovered, Deaths, Confirmed cases all over the globe.
